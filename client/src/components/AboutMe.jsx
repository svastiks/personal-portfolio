<b>My Program</b>
<br />
Bachelor of Engineering - Software Engineering (Big Data)

<br />
<br />

<b>Why do I love my program?</b>
<br />
A Bachelor's in Engineering comes with a lot of challenges but I love my program as it introduces me to like minded people and helps me
develop real world skills for my future.

<br />
<br />

<b>Coop Experience</b>
<br />
I have had many rewwarding coop experiences during my coop terms but one stands out would be when I worked on a project from start to finish.
During that project I learned that things rarely go as planned and you always have to be ready to learn more in order to be successful in a very
complex real world project.

<br />
<br />

<b>Career Goal?</b>
<br />

My main career goal is to stay in tech and eventually be in a position where I can run and accomplissh bigger milestones with my own team.
